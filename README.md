Upcycled Collection

By Mitch Johnson

Upcycled Collection is an interactive game experience that takes players through the concept of upcycling clothing. By navigating through the maze using the avatar, the player collects items of clothing on every screen until they reach the end point where they can see what they "created" from the collected clothing.
