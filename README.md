# Project-2


I want the user to control where the shirt goes and move it from screen to screen. I don't want the layout to be confusing otherwise the stroy will be harder to follow and the story is the main part of the game. I'm thinking 10ish screens to depcit the diffeent stages of the clothings life along with a possible make your own clothing part.

I want the palette to be pretty bright so the clothing part of the story stands out on top of a more pastel background.
